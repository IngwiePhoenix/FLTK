# This script generates latex/refman.pdf after doxygen has been executed.
#
# Input:  run `doxygen Doxybook' (creates files in subdirectory latex)
# Output: latex/refman.pdf (if successful)
#
# Next step: cp -f latex/refman.pdf fltk.pdf (why is this extra step needed ?)
#
# Working directory: fltk/documentation
#
# Used in: Makefile and CMakeLists.txt
