<H1 ALIGN=RIGHT><A NAME=glut>D - GLUT Compatibility</A></H1>
<P>This appendix describes the GLUT compatibility header file supplied with FLTK. FLTK's GLUT compatibility is based on the original GLUT 3.7 and the follow-on FreeGLUT 2.4.0 libraries.</P>
<H2>Using the GLUT Compatibility Header File</H2>
<P>You should be able to compile existing GLUT source code by including <TT>&lt;FL/glut.H&gt;</TT> instead of <TT>&lt;GL/glut.h&gt;</TT>.  This can be done by editing the source, by changing the <TT>-I</TT> switches to the compiler, or by providing a symbolic link from <TT>GL/glut.h</TT> to <TT>FL/glut.H</TT>.</P>
<P><I>All files calling GLUT procedures must be compiled with C++</I>. You may have to alter them slightly to get them to compile without warnings, and you may have to rename them to get make to use the C++ compiler.</P>
<P>You must link with the FLTK library. Most of <TT>FL/glut.H</TT> is inline functions.  You should take a look at it (and maybe at <TT>test/glpuzzle.cxx</TT> in the FLTK source) if you are having trouble porting your GLUT program. </P>
<P>This has been tested with most of the demo programs that come with the GLUT and FreeGLUT distributions.</P>
<H2>Known Problems</H2>
<P>The following functions and/or arguments to functions are missing, and
you will have to replace them or comment them out for your code to
compile:
<UL>
<LI><TT>glutGet(GLUT_ELAPSED_TIME)</TT></LI>
<LI><TT>glutGet(GLUT_SCREEN_HEIGHT_MM)</TT></LI>
<LI><TT>glutGet(GLUT_SCREEN_WIDTH_MM)</TT></LI>
<LI><TT>glutGet(GLUT_WINDOW_NUM_CHILDREN)</TT></LI>
<LI><TT>glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_LUMINANCE)</TT></LI>
<LI><TT>glutLayerGet(GLUT_HAS_OVERLAY)</TT></LI>
<LI><TT>glutLayerGet(GLUT_LAYER_IN_USE)</TT></LI>
<LI><TT>glutPushWindow()</TT></LI>
<LI><TT>glutSetColor(), glutGetColor(), glutCopyColormap()</TT></LI>
<LI><TT>glutVideoResize()</TT> missing. </LI>
<LI><TT>glutWarpPointer()</TT></LI>
<LI><TT>glutWindowStatusFunc()</TT></LI>
<LI>Spaceball, buttonbox, dials, and tablet functions</LI>
</UL>
 Most of the symbols/enumerations have different values than GLUT uses.
 This will break code that relies on the actual values. The only
symbols guaranteed to have the same values are true/false pairs like <TT>
GLUT_DOWN</TT> and <TT>GLUT_UP</TT>, mouse buttons <TT>
GLUT_LEFT_BUTTON, GLUT_MIDDLE_BUTTON, GLUT_RIGHT_BUTTON</TT>, and <TT>
GLUT_KEY_F1</TT> thru <TT>F12</TT>.
<P>The strings passed as menu labels are not copied. </P>
<P><TT>glutPostRedisplay()</TT> does not work if called from inside a
display function.  You must use <TT>glutIdleFunc()</TT> if you want
your display to update continuously. </P>
<P><TT>glutSwapBuffers()</TT> does not work from inside a display
function.  This is on purpose, because FLTK swaps the buffers for you. </P>
<P><TT>glutUseLayer()</TT> does not work well, and should only be used
to initialize transformations inside a resize callback.  You should
redraw overlays by using <TT>glutOverlayDisplayFunc()</TT>. </P>
<P>Overlays are cleared before the overlay display function is called. <TT>
glutLayerGet(GLUT_OVERLAY_DAMAGED)</TT> always returns true for
compatibility with some GLUT overlay programs.  You must rewrite your
code so that <TT>gl_color()</TT> is used to choose colors in an
overlay, or you will get random overlay colors. </P>
<P><TT>glutSetCursor(GLUT_CURSOR_FULL_CROSSHAIR)</TT> just results in a
small crosshair. </P>
<P>The fonts used by <TT>glutBitmapCharacter() and glutBitmapWidth()</TT>
 may be different. </P>
<P><TT>glutInit(argc,argv)</TT> will consume different switches than
GLUT does.  It accepts the switches recognized by <A href="Fl.html#Fl.args">
<TT>Fl::args()</TT></A>, and will accept any abbreviation of these
switches (such as &quot;-di&quot; for &quot;-display&quot;). </P>
<H2>Mixing GLUT and FLTK Code</H2>
 You can make your GLUT window a child of a <TT>Fl_Window</TT> with the
following scheme.  The biggest trick is that GLUT insists on <TT>show()</TT>
'ing the window at the point it is created, which means the <TT>
Fl_Window</TT> parent window must already be shown.
<UL>
<LI>Don't call <TT>glutInit()</TT>. </LI>
<LI>Create your <TT>Fl_Window</TT>, and any FLTK widgets.  Leave a
blank area in the window for your GLUT window. </LI>
<LI><TT>show()</TT> the <TT>Fl_Window</TT>.  Perhaps call <TT>
show(argc,argv)</TT>. </LI>
<LI>Call <TT>window-&gt;begin()</TT> so that the GLUT window will  be
automatically added to it. </LI>
<LI>Use <TT>glutInitWindowSize()</TT> and <TT>glutInitWindowPosition()</TT>
 to set the location in the  parent window to put the GLUT window. </LI>
<LI>Put your GLUT code next.  It probably does not need many changes.
 Call <TT>window-&gt;end()</TT> immediately after the <TT>
glutCreateWindow()</TT>! </LI>
<LI>You can call either <TT>glutMainLoop()</TT>, <TT>Fl::run()</TT>, or
loop calling <TT>Fl::wait()</TT> to run  the program. </LI>

<H3>Description</H3>
 Each GLUT window is an instance of this class.  You may find it useful
to manipulate instances directly rather than use GLUT window id's.
 These may be created without opening the display, and thus can fit
better into FLTK's method of creating windows.
<P>The current GLUT window is available in the global variable <TT>
glut_window</TT>. </P>
<P><TT>new Fl_Glut_Window(...)</TT> is the same as <TT>
glutCreateWindow()</TT> except it does not <TT>show()</TT> the window
or make the window current. </P>
<P><TT>window-&gt;make_current()</TT> is the same as <TT>
glutSetWindow(number)</TT>.  If the window has not had <TT>show()</TT>
 called on it yet, some functions that assumme an OpenGL context will
not work.  If you do <TT>show()</TT> the window, call <TT>make_current()</TT>
 again to set the context. </P>
<P><TT>~Fl_Glut_Window()</TT> is the same as <TT>glutDestroyWindow()</TT>
. </P>
<H3>Members</H3>
The <TT>Fl_Glut_Window</TT> class contains several public members that can
be altered directly:

 The first constructor takes 4 int arguments to create the window with
a preset position and size.  The second constructor with 2 arguments
will create the window with a preset size, but the window manager will
choose the position according to it's own whims.
<H4><A name=Fl_Glut_Window.~Fl_Glut_Window>virtual

 Destroys the GLUT window.

Switches all drawing functions to the GLUT window.
