<P>The FLTK distribution contains over 60 sample applications written
in, or ported to, FLTK. If the FLTK archive you received does not
contain a 'test' directory, you can download the complete FLTK
distribution from 
<a href="http://fltk.org/software.php">http://fltk.org/software.php</a>.</P>

<P>Most of the example programs were created while testing a group of widgets. 
They are not meant to be great achievements in clean C++ programming, but merely
a test platform to verify the functionality of the FLTK library.</P>

<h3><a name="adjuster">adjuster</h3>
<tt>adjuster</tt> shows a nifty little widget for quickly
setting values in a great range.

<h3><a name="arc">arc</h3>
The <tt>arc</tt> demo explains how to derive your own widget to
generate some custom drawings. The sample drawings use the matrix
based arc drawing for some fun effects.

<h3><a name="ask">ask</h3>
<tt>ask</tt> shows some of FLTK's standard dialog boxes. Click
the correct answers or you may end up in a loop, or you may end 
up in a loop, or you... .

<h3><a name="bitmap">bitmap</h3>
This simple test shows the use of a single color bitmap as a
label for a box widget. Bitmaps are stored in the X11 '.bmp' 
file format and can be part of the source code.

<h3><a name="blocks">blocks</h3>
A wonderful and addictive game that shows the usage of FLTK
timers, graphics, and how to implement sound on all platforms.
<tt>blocks</tt> is also a good example for the Mac OS X specific
bundle format.
 
<h3><a name="boxtype">boxtype</h3>
<tt>boxtype</tt> gives an overview of readily available boxes and
frames in FLTK. More types can be added by the application programmer. 
When using themes, FLTK shuffles boxtypes around to give your program
a new look.

<h3><a name="browser">browser</h3>
<tt>browser</tt> shows the capabilities of the <tt>Fl_Browser</tt> widget. 
Important features tested are loading of files, line formatting, and
correct positioning of the browser data window.

<h3><a name="button">button</h3>
The <tt>button</tt> test is a simple demo of push-buttons and callbacks.

<h3><a name="buttons">buttons</h3>
<tt>buttons</tt> shows a sample of FLTK button types.

<h3><a name="checkers">checkers</h3>
Written by Steve Poulsen in early 1979, <tt>checkers</tt> shows
how to convert a VT100 text-terminal based program into a neat
application with a graphical UI. Check out the code that drags the
pieces, and how the pieces are drawn by layering. Then tell me 
how to beat the computer at Checkers.

<h3><a name="clock">clock</h3>
The <tt>clock</tt> demo shows two analog clocks. The innards of
the <tt>Fl_Clock</tt> widget are pretty interesting, explaining
the use of timeouts and matrix based drawing.

<h3><a name="colbrowser">colbrowser</h3>
<tt>colbrowser</tt> runs only on X11 systems. It reads 
<i>/usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt</i> to show the color representation
of every text entry in the file. This is beautiful, but
only moderatly useful unless your UI is written in <i>Motif</i>.

<h3><a name="color_chooser">color_chooser</h3>
The <tt>color_chooser</tt> gives a short demo of FLTK's palette based
color chooser and of the RGB based color wheel.

<h3><a name="cube">cube</h3>
The <tt>cube</tt> demo shows the speed of OpenGL. It also tests
the ability to render two OpenGL buffers into a single window, 
and shows OpenGL text.

<h3><a name="CubeView">CubeView</h3>
<tt>CubeView</tt> shows how to create a UI containing OpenGL with Fluid.

<h3><a name="cursor">cursor</h3>
The <tt>cursor</tt> demo show all mouse cursor shapes that come standard
with FLTK. The <i>fgcolor</i> and <i>bgcolor</i> sliders work only
on few systems (some version of Irix for example).

<h3><a name="curve">curve</h3>
<tt>curve</tt> draws a nice Bezier curve into a custom widget. The 
<i>points</i> option for splines is not supported on all platforms.

<h3><a name="demo">demo</h3>
This tool allows quick access to all programs in the <tt>test</tt> directory. 
<tt>demo</tt> is based on the visuals of the IrixGL demo program. The menu 
tree can be changed by editing <tt>test/demo.menu</tt>.

<h3><a name="doublebuffer">doublebuffer</h3>
The <tt>doublebuffer</tt> demo show the difference between a single
buffered window, which may flicker during a slow redraw, and a 
double buffered window, which never flickers, but uses twice the
amount of RAM. Some modern OS's double buffer all windows automatically
to allow transparency and shadows on the desktop. FLTK is smart enough
to not tripple buffer a window in that case.

<h3><a name="editor">editor</h3>
FLTK has two very different text input widgets. <tt>Fl_Input</tt> 
and derived classes are rather leight weight, however 
<tt>Fl_Text_Editor</tt> is a complete port of <i>nedit</i> (with permission). 
The <tt>editor</tt> test is almost a full application, showing custom
syntax highlighting and dialog creation. 

<h3><a name="fast_slow">fast_slow</h3>
<tt>fast_slow</tt> shows how an application can use then <tt>when()</tt>
setting to receive different kinds of callbacks.

<h3><a name="file_chooser">file_chooser</h3>
The standard FLTK <tt>file_chooser</tt> is the result of many
iterations, trying to find a middle ground between a complex 
browser and a fast light implementation.

<h3><a name="fonts">fonts</h3>
<tt>fonts</tt> show all available text fonts on the host system.
If your machine still has some pixmap based fonts, the supported
sizes will be shown in bold face. Only the first 256 fonts will 
be listed.

<h3><a name="forms">forms</h3>
<tt>forms</tt> is an XForms program with very few changes.
Search for "fltk" to find all changes necessary to port to fltk.
This demo show the different boxtypes. Note that some
boxtypes are not appropriate for some objects.

<h3><a name="fractals">fractals</h3>
<tt>fractals</tt> shows how to mix OpenGL, Glut and FLTK code.
FLTK supports a rather large subset of Glut, so that many Glut
application compile just fine.

<h3><a name="fullscreen">fullscreen</h3>
This demo shows how to do many of the window manipulations that
are popular for games.
You can toggle the border on/off, switch between single- 
and double-buffered rendering, and take over the entire
screen. More information in the source code.

<h3><a name="gl_overlay">gl_overlay</h3>
<tt>gl_overlay</tt> shows OpenGL overlay plane rendering. If no
hardware overlay plane is available, FLTK will simulate it
for you.

<h3><a name="glpuzzle">glpuzzle</h3>
The <tt>glpuzzle</tt> test shows how most Glut source code compiles
easily under FLTK.

<h3><a name="hello">hello</h3>
<tt>hello</tt>: Hello, World. Need I say maore? Well, maybe. This 
tiny demo shows how little is needed to get a functioning application
running with FLTK. Quite impressive, I'd say.

<h3><a name="help">help</h3>
<tt>help</tt> displays the built-in FLTK help browser. The 
<tt>Fl_Help_Dialog</tt> understands a subset of html and renders
various image formats. This widget makes it easy to provide help
pages to the user without depending on the operating system's 
html browser.

<h3><a name="iconize">iconize</h3>
<tt>iconize</tt> demonstrates the effect of the window functions
<tt>hide()</tt>, <tt>iconize()</tt>, and <tt>show()</tt>.

<h3><a name="image">image</h3>
The <tt>image</tt> demo shows how an image can be created on the fly.
This generated image contains an alpha (transparency) channel which
lets previous renderings 'shine through', either via true 
transparency or by using screen door transparency (pixelation).

<h3><a name="inactive">inactive</h3>
<tt>inactive</tt> tests the correct rendering of inactive widgets.
To see the inactive version of images, you can check out the pixmap 
or image test.

<h3><a name="input">input</h3>
This tool shows and tests different types of text input fields based on
<tt>Fl_Input_</tt>. The <tt>input</tt> program also tests various 
settings of <tt>Fl_Input::when()</tt>.

<h3><a name="input_choice">input_choice</h3>
<tt>input_choice</tt> tests the latest addition to FLTK1, a text input 
field with an attached pulldown menu. Windows users will recognize 
similarities to the 'ComboBox'. <tt>input_choice</tt> starts up in 
'plastic' scheme, but the traditional scheme is also supported.

<h3><a name="keyboard">keyboard</h3>
FLTK unifies keyboard events for all platforms. The <tt>keyboard</tt>
test can be used to check the return values of <tt>Fl::event_key()</tt>
and <tt>Fl::event_text()</tt>. It is also great to see the modifier 
buttons and the scroll wheel at work. Quit this application by closing
the window. The ESC key will not work. 

<h3><a name="label">label</h3>
Every FLTK widget can have a label attached to it. The <tt>label</tt> 
demo shows alignment, clipping and wrapping of text labels. Labels
can contain symbols at the start and end of the text, like <i>@FLTK</i>
or <i>@circle uh-huh @square</i>.

<h3><a name="line_style">line_style</h3>
Advanced line drawing can be tested with <tt>line_style</tt>. 
Not all platforms support all line styles.

<h3><a name="list_visuals">list_visuals</h3>
This little app finds all available pixel formats for the current X11
screen. But since you are now an FLTK user, you don't have to worry 
about any of this.

<h3><a name="mandelbrot">mandelbrot</h3>
<tt>mandelbrot</tt> shows two advanced topics in one test. It creates
grayscale images on the fly, updating them via the <i>idle</i> callback
system. This is one of the few occasions where the <i>idle</i> callback
is very useful by giving all available processor time to the application
without blocking the UI or other apps.

<h3><a name="menubar">menubar</h3>
The <tt>menubar</tt> tests many aspects of FLTK's popup menu system.
Among the features are radio buttons, menus taller than the screen,
arbitrary sub menu depth, and global shortcuts.

<h3><a name="message">message</h3>
<tt>message</tt> pops up a few of FLTK's standars message boxes.

<h3><a name="minimum">minimum</h3>
The <tt>minimum</tt> test program verifies that the update regions
are set correctly. In a real life application, the trail would
be avoided by choosing a smaller label or by setting label clipping
differently. 

<h3><a name="navigation">navigation</h3>
<tt>navigation</tt> demonstrates how the text cursor moves from
text field to text field when using the arrow keys, tab, and shift-tab.

<h3><a name="output">output</h3>
<tt>output</tt> shows the difference between the single line and
multi line mode of the <tt>Fl_Output</tt> widget. Fonts can be
selected from the FLTK standard list of fonts.

<h3><a name="overlay">overlay</h3>
The <tt>overlay</tt> test app show how easy an FLTK window can
be layered to display cursor and manipulator style elemnts. This
example derives a new class from <tt>Fl_Overly_WIndow</tt> and 
provides a new function to draw custom overlays.

<h3><a name="pack">pack</h3>
The <tt>pack</tt> test program demonstrates the resizing
and repositioning of children of the <tt>Fl_Pack</tt> group.
Putting an <tt>Fl_Pack</tt> into an <tt>Fl_Scroll</tt> is 
a useful way to create a browser for large sets of data.

<h3><a name="pixmap_browser">pixmap_browser</h3>
<tt>pixmap_browser</tt> tests the shared-image interface. When using
the same image multiple times, <tt>Fl_Shared_Image</tt> will keep it
only once in memory.

<h3><a name="pixmap">pixmap</h3>
This simple test shows the use of a LUT based pixmap as a
label for a box widget. Pixmaps are stored in the X11 '.xpm' 
file format and can be part of the source code. Pixmaps support
one transparent color.

<h3><a name="preferences">preferences</h3>
I do have my <tt>preferences</tt> in the morning, but sometimes I
just can't remember a thing. This is where the <tt>Fl_Preferences</tt>
come in handy. They remember any kind of data between program launches.

<h3><a name="radio">radio</h3>
The <tt>radio</tt> tool was created entirely with <i>fluid</i>. It
shows some of the available button types and tests radio 
button behavior.

<h3><a name="resizebox">resizebox</h3>
<tt>resizebox</tt> shows some possible ways of FLTK's automatic
resize bahavior..

<h3><a name="resize">resize</h3>
The <tt>resize</tt> demo tests size and position functions with
the given window manager.

<h3><a name="scroll">scroll</h3>
<tt>scroll</tt> shows how to scroll an area of widgets, one of
them beeing a slow custom drawing. <tt>Fl_Scroll</tt> uses 
clipping and smart window area copying to improve redraw speed.
The buttons at the bottom of the window control decoration rendering
and updates.

<h3><a name="shape">shape</h3>
<tt>shape</tt> is a very minimal demo that shows how to create
your own OpenGL rendering widget. Now that you know that, go ahead 
and write that flight simulator you always dreamt of.

<h3><a name="subwindow">subwindow</h3>
The <tt>subwindow</tt> demo tests messaging and drawing between 
the main window and 'true' sub windows. A sub window is different
to a group by resetting the FLTK coordinate stystem to 0, 0 in the
top left corner. On Win32 and X11, subwindows have their own 
operating system specific handle.

<h3><a name="sudoku">sudoku</h3>
Another highly addictive game - don't play it, I warned you.
The implementation shows how to create application icons,
how to deal with OS specifics, and how to generate sound.

<h3><a name="symbols">symbols</h3>
<tt>symbols</tt> are a speciality of FLTK. These little vector 
drawings can be integrated into labels. They scale and rotate,
and with a little patience, you can define your own. The rotation 
number refers to 45 degree rotations if you were looking at a 
numeric keypad (2 is down, 6 is right, etc.).

<h3><a name="tabs">tabs</h3>
The <tt>tabs</tt> tool was created with <i>fluid</i>. It tests
correct hiding and redisplaying of tabs, navigation across tabs, 
resize behavior, and no unneeded redrawing of invisible widgets.

<P>The <tt>tabs</tt> application shows the <tt>Fl_Tabs</tt> widget
on the left and the <tt>Fl_Wizard</tt> widget on the right side 
for direct comparison of these two panel management widgets.

<h3><a name="threads">threads</h3>
FLTK can be used in a multithreading environment. There are some
limitations, mostly due to the underlying operating system. 
<tt>threads</tt> show how to use <tt>Fl::lock()</tt>, 
<tt>Fl::unlock()</tt>, and <tt>Fl::awake()</tt> in secondary threads 
to keep FLTK happy. Although locking works on all platforms, 
this demo is not available on every machine.

<h3><a name="tile">tile</h3>
The <tt>tile</tt> tool shows a nice way of using <tt>Fl_Tile</tt>.
To test correct resizing of subwindows, the widget for region 
1 is created from an <tt>Fl_Window</tt> class.

<h3><a name="tiled_image">tiled_image</h3>
The <tt>tiled_image</tt> demo uses an image as the background
for a window by repeating it over the full size of the widget.
Thw window is resizable and shows how the image gets repeated.

<h3><a name="valuators">valuators</h3>
<tt>valuators</tt> shows all of FLTK's nifty widgets to change
numeric values.

<h3><a name="fluid">fluid</h3>
<tt>fuid</tt> is not only a big test program, but also a very 
useful visual UI designer. Many parts of <tt>fluid</tt> were 
created using <tt>fluid</tt>.
