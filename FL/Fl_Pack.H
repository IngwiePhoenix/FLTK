/**
  This widget was designed to add the functionality of compressing and
  aligning widgets.
  <P>If type() is Fl_Pack::HORIZONTAL all the children are
  resized to the height of the Fl_Pack, and are moved next to
  each other horizontally. If type() is not Fl_Pack::HORIZONTAL
  then the children are resized to the width and are stacked below each
  other.  Then the Fl_Pack resizes itself to surround the child
  widgets.
  <P>This widget is needed for the Fl_Tabs.
  In addition you may want to put the Fl_Pack inside an 
  Fl_Scroll.

  <P>The resizable for Fl_Pack is set to NULL by default.</p>
  <P>See also: Fl_Group::resizable()
