/**
  This widget provides a standard menubar interface.  Usually you will
  put this widget along the top edge of your window.  The height of the
  widget should be 30 for the menu titles to draw correctly with the
  default font.
  <P>The items on the bar and the menus they bring up are defined by a
  single Fl_Menu_Item
  array.  Because a Fl_Menu_Item array defines a hierarchy, the
  top level menu defines the items in the menubar, while the submenus
  define the pull-down menus. Sub-sub menus and lower pop up to the right
  of the submenus. </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>\image html  menubar.gif</P>
  \image latex  menubar.eps " menubar" width=12cm
  <P>If there is an item in the top menu that is not a title of a
  submenu, then it acts like a "button" in the menubar.  Clicking on it
  will pick it. </P>
  <P>When the user picks an item off the menu, the item's callback is
  done with the menubar as the Fl_Widget* argument.  If the item
  does not have a callback the menubar's callback is done instead. </P>
  <P>Submenus will also pop up in response to shortcuts indicated by
  putting a '&' character in the name field of the menu item. If you put a
  '&' character in a top-level "button" then the shortcut picks it.  The
  '&' character in submenus is ignored until the menu is popped up. </P>
  <P>Typing the shortcut() of any of the menu items will cause
  callbacks exactly the same as when you pick the item with the mouse.
