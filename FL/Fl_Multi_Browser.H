  The Fl_Multi_Browser class is a subclass of Fl_Browser
  which lets the user select any set of the lines.  The user interface
  is Macintosh style: clicking an item turns off all the others and
  selects that one, dragging selects all the items the mouse moves over,
  and shift + click toggles the items. This is different then how forms
  did it.  Normally the callback is done when the user releases the
  mouse, but you can change this with when().
  <P>See Fl_Browser for methods to add and remove lines from the browser.
