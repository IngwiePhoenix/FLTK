/**
    This widget is based off the Fl_Tabs
    widget, but instead of displaying tabs it only changes "tabs" under
    program control. Its primary purpose is to support "wizards" that
    step a user through configuration or troubleshooting tasks.

    <P>As with Fl_Tabs, wizard panes are composed of child (usually
    Fl_Group) widgets. Navigation buttons must be added separately.
