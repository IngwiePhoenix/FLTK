README
------

The documentation in this directory is in PDF format.
To read it, please open the file "fltk.pdf" in this directory.

To generate the doxygen HTML documention, you should have Doxygen
version 1.5.7 or later. Use "make clean html" in the documentation
directory to generate the HTML documentation.

To read it, please open the file "html/index.html" with your browser.
A documentation version is also available at the FLTK web site,
along with the PDF version of the manual. The docs on the web site
are usually somewhat older (latest release).

You can generate your own copy of the PDF manual by typing "make pdf"
in this directory. The resulting file is "latex/refman.pdf". This is
so that "make pdf" does not overwrite the bundled file "fltk.pdf".

If you type "make pdf-dist" instead, the original file "fltk.pdf"
will be overwritten.

Note that it is usually not necessary to create your own PDF version,
if you use the release version of FLTK, because it comes with a current
"fltk.pdf" file. However, if you use subversion or a snapshot file,
then the included "fltk.pdf" file is likely to be outdated.

If you find any typos, things that are unclear, or would like to
contribute an example, section, or chapter to the FLTK manual, please
post a question in the fltk newsgroup fltk.general or post a bug
report or feature request at http://www.fltk.org/str.php .
