# Notes:
#
# 1) Console windows appearing
#
#    Consoles will not appear when run from a command line prompt
#    but will cause an 'unnecessary' console to appear when run directly from
#    windows (say explorer). It provides i/o for stdin/stdout for debugging
#
#    To avoid this add "-mwindows" to LDLIBS and GLDLIBS below
#
# 2) Stripping the executable to reduce size
#
#    An external program may be run to strip out any debug symbols:
#    strip filename.exe
# 
#    Alternatively add -s option to LDLIBS and GLDLIBS below to strip all
#    symbols. (or -S for stripping of debug symbols only). See 'ld' man page
#    for other useful link-time options.
#
# The default is to leave -mwindows and the stripping off, so as to facilitate
# debugging. For release it may be appropriate to add these additional switches
