/*
 * This WinMain() function can be overridden by an application and
 * is provided for compatibility with programs written for other
 * operating systems that conform to the ANSI standard entry point
 * "main()".  This will allow you to build a WIN32 Application
 * without any special settings.
 *
 * Because of problems with the Microsoft Visual C++ header files
 * and/or compiler, you cannot have a WinMain function in a DLL.
 * I don't know why.  Thus, this nifty feature is only available
 * if you link to the static library.
 *
 * Currently the debug version of this library will create a
 * console window for your application so you can put printf()
 * statements for debugging or informational purposes.  Ultimately
 * we want to update this to always use the parent's console,
 * but at present we have not identified a function or API in
 * Microsoft(r) Windows(r) that allows for it.
