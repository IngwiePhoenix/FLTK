/** Any text editing widget should call this for each FL_KEYBOARD event.
 Use of this function is very simple.
 
 <p>If <i>true</i> is returned, then it has modified the
 Fl::event_text() and Fl::event_length() to a set of <i>bytes</i> to
 insert (it may be of zero length!).  In will also set the "del"
 parameter to the number of <i>bytes</i> to the left of the cursor to
 delete, this is used to delete the results of the previous call to
 Fl::compose().
 
 <p>If <i>false</i> is returned, the keys should be treated as function
 keys, and del is set to zero. You could insert the text anyways, if
 you don't know what else to do.
 
 <p>Though the current implementation returns immediately, future
 versions may take quite awhile, as they may pop up a window or do
 other user-interface things to allow characters to be selected.
