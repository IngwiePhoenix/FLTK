    Important note to IDE users:
  ============================================================================

  This file *may* be edited *before* building FLTK with your IDE project,
  i.e. in /path/to/fltk/ide/<your-ide>/FL/abi-version.h:

    (1) Define FL_ABI_VERSION as described below.
    (2) Rebuild the entire FLTK library.
    (3) Optional: install files as usual including THIS file.

  DO NOT edit this file after building the FLTK library, i.e. when this
  file is already installed in a (system) directory used to build your
  programs.

  Editing this file w/o rebuilding the entire FLTK library will change
  the ABI and thus render your programs unusable - they may crash or
  show other unpredictable errors. You have been warned!

  Define FL_ABI_VERSION as 10x0y for FLTK ABI version 1.x.y .
  Do NOT define FL_ABI_VERSION if you want the ABI compatible default build.

  ============================================================================
    End of important note to IDE users.
